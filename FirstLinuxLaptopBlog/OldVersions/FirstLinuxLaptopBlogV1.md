## July 9th 2020

I finally switched to Linux on July 9th 2020. I was originally going to wait a week before switching to this new Ubuntu laptop, so that I could test it out, but I just wanted to switch so badly, and it was working fine for the first day, so I began to copy files over.

I got a laptop with Ubuntu 20.04 pre-installed. I was originally going to switch to Fedora first thing, but I decided to just stick with Ubuntu for now, and switch to Fedora on my next laptop.

The laptop is pretty small, but it has high specs, including an octo-core CPU, a 1 terabyte Solid State Drive, 1920x1200 display, and Ubuntu 20.04 pre-installed.

Some cons are that the laptop is really small, the caps lock key timing is weird, so I constantly type 2 characters in caps lock and have to correct myself. Example: instead of typing `Sentence starts here` I would type `SEntence starts here` and then I have to correct this. ALong with `.md` becoming `.Md` due to `IGNORE.Md` instead of `IGNORE.md`

I was originally going to test the laptop for a full week before switching over, but it was so great on the first day, and I was so excited to get away from Windows 10 and enter the magnificently beautiful and remarkable world of Linux. So I copied over 260+ Gigabytes of my data. There are still many things I haven't added in yet, such as my Firefox profiles, SNU distribution data, and some other files.

> * How to see how much space is being used

> * How to select the correct city on the world map during setup

> * How to fix screen flickering issues with auto-brightness settings 2x

## July 10th 2020 Linux discoveries

This was my first all Linux work day, yesterday, most of my GitHub work was done on Windows 10. Today, everything was done on Ubuntu Linux 20.04

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux 20.04 today:

> * How easy it is to upload .url and .ink files on Linux compared to Windows

> * How to change the color of CPU cores, RAM, SWAP, etc.

## July 11th 2020 Linux discoveries

What I learned on Ubuntu 20.04 today:

> * The FN + ^ v functions, as my computers keyboard merged the arrow and page down/up buttons

> * How to customize GNOME via a terminal, I learned how to put seconds on the clock

> * That you can use nearly any character in a folder name, unlike Windows 10, which restricts several terms. Some ones that work on Linux and not Windows include: `@` `%` `^` `*` `{` `}` `<` `>` with only 1 key not working `/` and also not being able to use the `.` key alone, or with other `.` keys.
